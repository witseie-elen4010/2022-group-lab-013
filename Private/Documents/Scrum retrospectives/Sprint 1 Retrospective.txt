#### Scrum master: @HyChriFo

#### Project Goal
Develop a multiplayer word-guessing game based on Wordle, using NOde.js and hosted on Azure.

#### Sprint goal
~ Create a basic game board for the Guessle (Wordle clone) game
~ Generate and populate a GUI board with 5x6 blocks
~ Generate a random word to be assigned for users to guess
~ Allow users to input their guesses using keyboard
~ Give the user feedback on their guess in terms of colour changes per individual letter
   -Yellow blocks correspond to a letter in the word but in the incorrect place. 
   -Grey block indicate an incorrect letter.
   -Green blocks indicate a correct letter
~ User is only able to input valid word

The achieved website is: https://guessle.azurewebsites.net/

#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week

#### Moderation
#issue 11 which generates the random word for the user to guess can be done more effectively using an API
#issue 4 If user input includes repeated incorrect letter, game feedback colours both letter blocks rather than the one.

#### Successes
~ Closed all issues
~ Team has a working branch
~ Developed a functial webpage


#### Failures
~ Exceeded time durantion of sprint due to branch integration and deployment complications.
~ Collaboration as a team
~ Communication skills
~ Backlog: Project was not planned in its entirety, but according to Sprints, and thus the backlog is insufficient.
~ Workflow:
Scrum board was not used throughout project. It was created at the end of sprint 1.
Trunk based development approach was not executed adequately. Multiple merging branches were created as opposed to one master branch.
Sprint goals were not identitifed in their entirety due to poor planning.

#### Improvements
~ Merging of branches: Merging of code from feature branches into main
~ Code structure: Functions scattered resulting in a larger number of script files with the same function
