#### Duration of Sprint: 1 week

#### Moderation
#Issue 26 and 27 are not implemented and integrated into the program due to issues in how the page calls scripts
#Issue 32, 33 and 36 were not implemented due to their reliance on the issues above
#Issue 34 was implemented but is not yet integrated into main due to the abovementioned problems

#### Successes
~ Team integration is much improved
~ Team is reviewing with meaningful comments and code changes
~ Improved planning and utilisation of the scrum board
~ The trunk-based development is now done properly 
~ Sprint goals were identified in their entirety
~ Sprint was done in 1 week as intended

#### Failures
~ People were assigned to user stories that rely on other individual's stories
~ When team mates were struggling with stories, communication was lacking and thus adjustments couldn't be made in a timely fashion

#### Improvements
~ The quality of the architecture of the code needs to be improved. To avoid issues with require and html navigation, .jes files should be used
~ Bootstrap needs to be used for the front-end

#### Velocity for sprint

- Possible points for 14 user stories: 41

		#### Achieved Velocity for Sprint 2: 31
